# Practical: gRPC Microservices with Docker

This practical demonstrates the implementation of two communicating microservices using gRPC, containerized with Docker, and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Overview

This project showcases:
- gRPC-based inter-service communication
- Microservices architecture with Docker containerization
- Service orchestration using Docker Compose
- Protocol Buffer definitions for type-safe communication
